Start Quickly
-------------

Alright, let's get you going. I'm assuming that your operating system is a
debian linux distribution like Ubuntu_, that you're using Python_ version
2.7, and that you are able to access your terminal_.

If you haven't already, you can install GatherNews via pip:

.. code-block:: console

$ pip install gathernews

Now let's set up a project.

.. code-block:: console

$ mkdir my_project
$ cd my_project
$ touch feeds_list.txt


.. _Ubuntu: http://www.ubuntu.com/
.. _Python: http://python.org/download/
.. _terminal: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal
